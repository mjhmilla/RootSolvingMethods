# Root Solving Methods

This is a collection of Matlab implementations of root solving methods along with a set of test functions. This repository exists because I'm looking for a method that is more robust than Newton's method and faster than the bisection method. So far the root solving methods include

- I. F. D. Oliveira and R. H. C. Takahashi. 2020. An Enhancement of the Bisection Method Average Performance Preserving Minmax Optimality. ACM Trans. Math. Softw. 47, 1, Article 5 (March 2021), 24 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3423597

and the test functions include

- Lambert function
- Polyfrac function
- Tan Poly function
- Sawtooth function
